reticulating splines
tracking IP addresses with GUI interface using Visual Basic
drowning sims in pool
yelling at kids on lawn
packaging companion cubes for testing
developing self awareness
solving the halting problem
calculating the answer to life, the universe, and everything
coping with meaningless existance
balancing hearthstone classes
praying to RNGesus
writing Dan language
setting multiple fork-bombs
hoping for tokens at the back of MTG booster packs
rolling dice for new D&D character
